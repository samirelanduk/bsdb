                            <p>We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Internal record keeping;</li>

                            <p>We do not disclose individual information to our sponsors and advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users. We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target. We would comply with our advertisers' wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience using the personal data we have collected from you and from others.</p>
                            <p>We do, however, reserve the right to attempt to identify and track any individual who is reasonably suspected of trying to gain unauthorised access to computer systems or resources operating as part of our web services.</p>
                            <h3>How we use cookies</h3>
                            <p>A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.</p>
                            <p>This website does not store any information that would, on its own, allow us to identify individual users of this service without their permission. Any cookies that may be used by this website are used either solely on a per session basis or to maintain user preferences. Cookies are not shared with any third parties.</p>

                            <p>We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyse data about web page traffic and improve our website in order to tailor it to customer needs.</p>
                            <p>Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.</p>
                            <p>You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your <a  href="http://civicuk.com/cookie-law/browser-settings" target="_blank">browser setting</a> to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the website.</p>
                            <p><b>PLEASE NOTE, not accepting the below cookies will severely harm our continued operation, we will no longer be able to track visits to our website, see what the most popular pages are or devices looking at our website.
